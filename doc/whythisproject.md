### Why this project
We used ijkplayer in our products several years ago, and of course, we encountered many problems, some of them solved with support from open source project, but more solved by ourselves without external help, and we also developed some new features. 
Now we want to share all these changes with more users, and continue supporting it to be more powerful and wide-used. This is the reason why BikPlayer appears, it is derived from bilibili's ijkplayer open source project, provide more outstanding features and continuous issue & technical support. 
If you have any issues about this player, or suggestions, please contact us and discuss with us. :smiley:
